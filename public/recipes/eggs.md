# The Science of Eggs

I've been captivated by the rich contrasts of eggs cooked in their shells ever since I first tasted a deviled egg decades ago. While modern trends like the sous-vide "63-degree" egg have gained popularity, producing eggs where both yolk and white are creamy, I still prefer the classic mollet egg. Boiled for 5 or 6 minutes, the mollet egg is making a well-deserved comeback in salads and noodle dishes.

## The 63-Degree Egg vs. Mollet Egg

One undeniable advantage of the 63-degree egg is the ease of peeling. Simply crack the shell, and the egg slides out with minimal fuss. This contrasts sharply with other gently cooked eggs, where peeling can be an unpredictable and frustrating experience. Some eggs release cleanly from their shells, while others cling stubbornly, resulting in torn whites and frustration.

## Experimenting with Egg Peeling Techniques

Over the years, I've tested countless methods to make peeling easier, from pre-poking the shell to boiling with baking soda or shocking eggs in ice water. One method, widely demonstrated online, involves blowing the egg out of its shell by creating a small opening at each end. While quick and showy, it's not particularly hygienic, and it often fails with stubborn eggs.

After these experiments, I decided to tackle the peeling problem head-on. It turns out that eggs are remarkably complex, and finding a reliable solution was no simple task. However, I eventually developed a method that, while a bit messy, is both effective and entertaining.

## The Role of pH in Egg Peeling

The key to easier peeling lies in the egg’s pH. Fresh eggs are notoriously difficult to peel because their whites are slightly alkaline, around a pH of 7.5. As eggs age, they lose moisture and carbon dioxide through their porous shells, increasing the pH of the white to around 9, making the egg easier to peel. The shift in pH reduces the adhesion between the egg white and the shell's inner membrane, though the exact mechanism remains unclear.

This change in pH happens over several days at room temperature but takes much longer in the refrigerator. A refrigerated egg may take two or more weeks to reach a pH of 9. This explains why even store-bought eggs can be difficult to peel—they haven’t aged enough to become alkaline.

## Speeding Up the Process: Acid and Alkali Treatments

To speed up the process, I first considered storing eggs at room temperature or in a warm oven, but this still took days. Instead, I turned to chemistry. By immersing eggs in a very alkaline solution at pH 12, I could artificially raise the pH, but it still required several days.

Then I had a breakthrough: the shell itself was the main obstacle. To make the egg more accessible to the alkaline bath, I decided to start with an acid treatment. By soaking the eggs in citric acid for about an hour, I could etch away much of the shell, making it thinner and easier to peel. After this, a few hours in an alkaline solution was sufficient to raise the egg white’s pH just beneath the shell.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Easier Peeling

The entire process takes about four hours, with only about 30 minutes of active work. You'll need two key ingredients: citric acid, often sold as "sour salt," and baked baking soda, which is made by heating regular baking soda in a 350°F oven for a couple of hours. Baked baking soda is a stronger alkali, capable of reaching a pH of 12.

1. **Prepare the Citric Acid Solution**:  
   Dissolve about 1 cup (200 grams) of citric acid in a quart of water in a large bowl. The eggs will fizz as the acid reacts with their shells, releasing carbon dioxide. Gently rub the foamy scum off the eggs every 15 to 20 minutes to speed up the process. After 45 to 90 minutes, when small clear spots appear on the eggshells, remove and rinse them.

2. **Alkaline Soak**:  
   Immerse the etched eggs in a solution of baked baking soda—4 teaspoons (10 grams) per quart of water. Let them soak for 2 to 6 hours, stirring gently every 15 to 20 minutes. Afterward, rinse the eggs and either cook them immediately or refrigerate them for later use.

I've tried this method on several dozen fresh eggs, and it works remarkably well. The weakened shells often peel off in long, papery spirals, making the once frustrating task of peeling a breeze.

## Further Experimentation: Century Egg-Inspired Method

For those looking to experiment further, letting the eggs sit in the alkaline solution overnight before cooking will result in a more translucent and flavorful white, edging toward the Chinese century egg.

## Egg Yolk Color and Hen Diet

While we're on the topic, it's worth noting that the color of an egg yolk, while visually appealing, doesn't necessarily indicate how the hen was raised or the egg's nutritional value. Battery hens' feeds are often enhanced with pigments like lutein and zeaxanthin, which can mimic the deep yellow-orange color seen in eggs from free-range hens. Ultimately, the best way to understand an egg's quality is to know the hen's owner and ask about its diet.

## Cooking Tips for a Vibrant Yolk

To best showcase the yolk's color, avoid overcooking the egg. The more you leave the yolk moist, the clearer and deeper its color will remain.

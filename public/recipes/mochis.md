# Mochi Rice (Mochigome)

[Mochigome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutinous_rice), commonly known as mochi rice, is a glutinous rice variety that, despite its name, does not contain gluten (the proteins found in wheat). However, it exhibits similar properties due to its high starch content.

### What is Starch?
Starch is a storage form of sugar used by plants, where glucose molecules are linked in long, stable chains. These chains are typically stored in seeds, providing the energy needed for growth until the plant can perform photosynthesis. This process forms multiple layers of starch molecules into granules ranging from 1 to 100 microns thick (about the thickness of a human hair).

Most rice varieties contain two types of starch: [amylose](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylose) and [amylopectine](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amylopectine) in varying proportions.

#### Amylose
Amylose is a long chain of glucose molecules that gives rice a "crystalline" structure. It requires more water to cook, tends not to clump together, and hardens significantly upon cooling, as the amylose molecules align and crystallize outside of the starch granules.

#### Amylopectin
Amylopectin consists of highly branched glucose chains, giving it an "amorphous" structure.

The differences in the proportion of amylose and amylopectin in rice varieties result in a wide range of textures, not only in rice but also in corn starch-based puddings and other foods. Notably, the amount of amylose decreases with the length of the rice grain, meaning that shorter grains predominantly contain amylopectin.

Mochi rice is unique in that it is composed almost entirely of amylopectin.

### How Mochi Rice Behaves with Water
When starch granules in mochi rice come into contact with water, they absorb it completely, causing the granules to swell and "explode," which creates the appealing, sticky, and gooey texture associated with mochi.

This process is known as "gelatinization" (despite the absence of gelatin, which is protein-based). As gelatinization progresses, the water molecules irreversibly disrupt the tightly packed arrangement of starch molecules, resulting in a thick mixture of hydrated, swollen granules.

It's important to note that mochi rice is exclusively white.

## Traditional Mochi-Making Method

1. **Cook the rice**: Steam or boil the rice.
2. **Moisten the rice**: Use hot water to wet the rice.
3. **Pound the rice**: Use a pestle and mortar to crush the rice for 15 to 20 minutes until a shiny, sticky, and elastic dough forms. The consistency depends on the speed and intensity of pounding, as well as the amount of rice used.
4. **Shape the mochi**: Wet your hands to shape the dough into small balls.
5. **Dust with rice flour**: Apply a small amount of rice flour to prevent sticking.
6. **Fill with sweet paste**: Place a bit of red bean paste or another sweet filling in the center of each mochi ball.

## Easy Mochi-Making Method

1. **Mix and knead**: Combine rice flour (mochiko) and water into a dough, then knead and heat it alternately in an oven or microwave until the desired consistency is achieved.

During this process, the swollen and gelatinized starch granules burst, and kneading helps the amylopectin molecules start aligning into a network, particularly as the dough cools.

Without amylose, which would normally form a resistant gel as the rice paste cools and straight chains align, the amylopectin-based gel remains relatively disorganized. The texture stays soft and pliable, and because amylopectin is so flexible and slow to crystallize, mochi can even be frozen and thawed without losing much of its characteristic texture, enabling the creation of ice cream-filled daifuku mochi.

### Notes:
For best results, after blending the mixture, let it sit overnight before straining. This allows the water to extract maximum flavor from the rice and almonds. The four-hour method works but yields a less intense flavor. Some horchata "experts" prefer to let the mixture sit overnight to soften before blending.
